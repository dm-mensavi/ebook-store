## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Programming & Validation
- Global validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe`
- FP practices:  
  - `map()`, `filter()` instead of `for`/`if`  
  - Nullish coalescing (`??`) and destructuring  
- Clean, reusable Presenters to shape API responses

---

## üìö Documentation
- Swagger (optional, future step)
- See `src/modules/**` for DTOs, Presenters, and Repositories

---

## üß™ Testing
- 100% unit test coverage for services and controllers
- E2E tests cover HTTP requests & database integration
- Run `npm run test:cov` for coverage reports

---

## üìå To-Do / Improvements
- Add Swagger API docs (`@nestjs/swagger`)
- Seed database with fixtures
- Implement user authentication (optional)
- Pagination for large datasets (optional)
- Dockerize the app (optional)
